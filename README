###bikr package

The main purpose of the bikr package is to create a objective way to rate the quality of bicycle infrastructure in a given area by comparing to the gold standard of bicycle provision found in the Amsterdam region.

Currently, the package rates cycle paths, national cycle routes and bicycle parking provision as three key indicators of bicycle infrastucture. Cycle path fragmentation, cycle lanes and quiet street ratings are for future development.

The primary data source is OpenStreetMap data although it is conceivable other sources could be used.

The openstreetmap data requires a postgressql database created using osm2postgresql. The script for extracting the relevant data is in data-raw folder.
