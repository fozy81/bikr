@article{Handy2011,
abstract = {Although bicycling as a mode of transportation can mitigate traffic congestion, improve environmental quality, and yield health benefits, it accounts for a small share of all commute trips in the U.S. This paper aims to expand our understanding of the individual decision to bicycle commute through a cross-sectional study of bicycle commuting in six small U.S. cities. The study was designed to explore the relationships between bicycle commuting and socio-demographic characteristics, individual attitudes, and the physical and social environments of the workplace. Results show that residential preference for a good environment for bicycling, a measure of self-selection, is associated with bicycle commuting. The physical environment, including a short distance to work, safe streets for bicycling, and high monthly parking costs around the workplace, is also important. The social environment of the workplace has an impact as well. This research provides an empirical basis for the development of policies and programs to increase bicycle commuting.},

@article{Ngoduy2013,
abstract = {This paper aims to describe a model which represents the formulation of decision-making processes (over a number of years) affecting the step-changes of walking and cycling (WaC) schemes. These processes can be seen as being driven by a number of causal factors, many of which are associated with the attitudes of a variety of factors, in terms of both determining whether any scheme will be implemented and, if it is implemented, the extent to which it is used. The outputs of the model are pathways as to how the future might unfold (in terms of a number of future time steps) with respect to specific pedestrian and cyclist schemes. The transitions of the decision making processes are formulated using a qualitative simulation method, which describes the step-changes of the WaC scheme development. In this article a Bayesian belief network (BBN) theory is extended to model the influence between and within factors in the dynamic decision making process. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

@article{Rybarczyk2010,
abstract = {Sustainable transport has become an important goal in transportation planning and research in recent decades. One emphasis of sustainable transport is to develop a multi-modal transportation system, in which bicycling facility planning is playing an important role. Recently, many bicycle facility planning methods have been proposed, and can be divided into two groups: supply- and demand-based models. While these two groups of models have been applied separately, few studies, however, have incorporated variables from these two groups of models together for bicycle facility planning. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) analysis to integrate both supply- and demand-based criteria for bicycle facility planning. Analysis was performed at two geographic levels: network level and neighborhood level, and a Geographic Information System (GIS) based exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) method was applied to explore the spatial patterns of bicycle facilities at the neighborhood level. This model was applied to Milwaukee City, WI, U.S.A., and results suggest that a combination of GIS and MCE analysis can serve as a better alternative to plan for optimal bicycle facilities, highlighting inadequacies of typical supply-side measures, and meet multiple planning objectives of government agencies, planners and bicyclists. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
