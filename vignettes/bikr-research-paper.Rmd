## Abstract

Many cities, regions and countries across the world are looking to improve their cycling infrastructure. The perceived outcomes of improvements are numberous including human health, air pollution, traffic noise reduction, carbon saving and cyclist/predestrian safety. This paper shows an approach to classifying the quality of cycle infrastructure, assessing the impact of planned changes, projecting what is required in terms of cost and assessing whether the presumed outcomes have been reached. It builds on work in a number of fields including volunteered geographic information (VGI), digital dashboard design and city monitoring projects and is influenced by various classification, ranking and index metrics. This systems shows a useful platform for comparing, contrasting and planning infrastructure can be created and shared. A number of recommendations for further research are outlined.

## Introduction

Bicycles are the 'intermediate technology' of choice for alleviating many problems of the technological advanced societies. The advances in sedentry and inactive means of  transport has lead to a realisation that the potential benefits of speed, cost and efficiency of these methods can overlook the benefits inherent in active transport and less 'advanced' forms of transport such as exercise, pollution, human health and lower environmental impact. 

Without some reference points and models to approach improving the existing transport system it is hard to gauge where a particular area performs and what is required to improve it.

Bicycle infrastructure comes from three broad areas

*Legislation
*Design Guidelines
*Public support

The simple answer to improving bicycle infrastructure is to legislate improvements. But that still leaves a question of where to start and exactly what outcomes are expected. There requires a common framework and platform for sharing, analysing, rating and developing policy for transport including active and bicycle based transport.

## The platform

There are a number of existing systems for rating cycle infrassturue...

What data is available....census, national agencies, 

OpenStreetMap...international and lots of data...

Supplement with other data...

R package, postGIS, open-source

## Metrics and classification

sub-metrics, overall metrics, weigthings

### Terminology

* cycle path
* bicycle parking area
* national cycle route

### PostGIS Queries

empirical evidence?

ground truthing

## Model

Outcomes Vs classification

## Use cases

* What does a planned improvement delivery
* What are the likely outcomes

## Future developmemt

Integrate more data from APIs. Creating a collalorative platform form for bicycle research through API, versioning and code/data sharing.
